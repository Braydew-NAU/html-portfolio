                        <h4>Projects</h4>
                        <strong>Ascii Art</strong>
                        <br/>
                        This was a project where I had to use character on the English keyboard to build a cactus shape.
                        <br/>
                        <br/>
                        <strong>Yatzhee</strong>
                        <br/>
                        This was a program that randomly generated number 1-6 and then scanned the list the numbers were in to see if there were any sets for the game of yatzhee. It did not have the feature to keep some dice it just rerolled all of them.
